# Networks and Systems Distributed Systems Coursework

In this coursework I was to implement a fault tolerant distributed system based on passive replication, supporting online food ordering and delivery.

## Requirements

### System Design

Using a diagram, illustrate major operation workflow flows among back-end servers, the front-end server and a client, and show how they work together as a distributed system

### Back-end server implementation

With passive replication, implement at least three back end servers to accept, process and make responses to user orders. The implementation should fulfil the location, relocation, replication and failure transparency requirements.

### Client Implementation

Implement a client program to allow a user to access the required distributed system by making food ordering requests and receiving system responses.

### Use of web services

Incorporate external web services to support delivery address retrieval by postal code. The implementation should treat web services as distributed system components and fulfil suitable transparency requirements.
